# IOT_BASED_SMART_WAREHOUSING
India is one of the largest agricultural land in the world with approximately 179.9 million hectares under cultivation. Still in India, food grains are stored at warehouse using traditional technology which leads to problems such as theft, rain, flood, variation in temperature and humidity, attacks of rodents, insects, rats etc. In this project we integrate smart sensing devices with Internet of Things (IOT) and Wireless Sensor Networks to preserve the quality and quantity of the stored products over time.
 	Degradation of grains during storage depends principally on a combination of factors like:  1. Temperature. 2. Moisture Content. Temperature and moisture are determining factors in accelerating or delaying the complex phenomena of the biochemical transformation (especially the "breathing" of the grain) that are at the origin of grain degradation
  The main objective of this project is to preserve the food grains at warehouses and also threat to destruction of stored crops, due to variation in temperature, excess humidity, fire, theft, rain, flood, etc. So that stored food grains can be delivered as and when required (real time). In this project we are integrating Internet of Things with smart sensors to improve the efficiency of food preservation in warehouse.
